    "## What is Model Extraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model extraction is a technique used to infer the properties, structure, or parameters of a machine learning model based solely on its outputs. This process can reveal insights about how input variables are transformed into predictions, allowing for the replication or analysis of the model without direct access to its internal workings. It plays a crucial role in understanding proprietary, black-box models, ensuring transparency and fairness in machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with access to a machine learning model through an API endpoint. This endpoint accepts a parameter named Hunger, representing the hunger level of a bear on a scale from 0 to 100 (inclusive), and returns the bear's Happiness level as a response. Although this scenario is simplified, it presents a practical introduction to the strategies and considerations involved in model extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Below are the steps we will walk through to solve this challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Explore the Endpoint`: Begin by making initial requests to the API with varied Hunger values. Note the structure of the responses and any patterns or anomalies in the Happiness outputs. This step helps you understand the range and type of data you'll be working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Data Collection`: Systematically collect data points by sending requests across the entire range of Hunger values (0-100). Consider automating this process with a script that iterates through possible Hunger values, capturing the corresponding Happiness levels. This dataset will be foundational for your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Analysis`: With your collected data, analyze the relationship between Hunger and Happiness. Look for trends, such as linear relationships, curvatures, or discrete jumps, that can give clues about the underlying model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Model Replication`: Based on your analysis, attempt to replicate the model's behavior. This could involve fitting a regression model, using machine learning algorithms, or applying mathematical theories to approximate the discovered relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Extraction and Reporting`: Finally, extract the coefficient that quantifies the relationship between Hunger and Happiness. Submit this to the endpoint to receive the flag!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge we are given access to a machine learning model through an API endpoint. The endpoint takes in the `Hunger` value of a bear (values between 1-100) and return the `Happiness` of the bear. This is a simple example but will help us understand the techniques we can use to extract data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start by testing the API endpoint and seeing what types of outputs we get."
