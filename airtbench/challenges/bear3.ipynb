        "Welcome to the \"Bear 3 - Model Fingerprinting\" challenge, where your skills in exploiting AI systems will be put to the test. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to determine the specific type of machine learning model being used by an API endpoint. Identifying a model's architecture and preprocessing steps is crucial for understanding its strengths and weaknesses. This knowledge enables a security professional to anticipate potential vulnerabilities, tailor attacks or defenses, and optimize their interactions with the model without excessive querying that could lead to detection or access denial."
