        "## Tutorial - Prompt Injection\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will equip you with knowledge on:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Understanding the foundational setup of Large Language Models (LLMs) to resist responding to certain prohibited queries.\n",
        "2. Exploring techniques used to obfuscate and manipulate these models.\n",
        "3. Applying these techniques against a real LLM to test their effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prompt injection** is a cunning technique devised to circumvent model defenses by embedding or altering prompts in a way that induces the model to respond with otherwise restricted information.\n",
        "\n",
        "To grasp the concept of LLM evasion, it's essential to comprehend how LLMs are fortified against such attacks:\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs undergo two primary training phases:\n",
        "  1. **Pre-training:** This initial stage involves training the model on vast quantities of text data from the internet. While this data may contain non-politically correct (non-PC) information, the primary goal is to develop the model's understanding of word relationships and language structure.\n",
        "  2. **Fine-tuning:** In this critical phase, models are trained on a smaller set of high-quality text. It's during fine-tuning that the model acquires its distinct \"tone\" or \"voice.\" This stage also involves adjusting the model to avoid mentioning controversial information and to ensure responses are ethically aligned.\n",
        "  3. **Post-training safety alignment:** After the core model capabilities are established, many enterprise models undergo specialized safety alignment procedures. As detailed in the \"SafetyBench\" paper (Jiang et al., 2024), this phase involves techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Constitutional AI (CAI), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to further reduce harmful outputs. This stage is crucial for ensuring models resist adversarial prompts, avoid generating unsafe content, and maintain ethical boundaries in real-world deployments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To defend against jailbreaking attempts, models utilize several strategies:\n",
        "  1. **Preprompt Instructions:** These are directives provided to the model before processing any user requests, guiding it on how to handle or avoid certain topics.\n",
        "  2. **Prompt Filtering:** Mechanisms are implemented to reject queries that contain specific keywords or patterns deemed inappropriate or off-limits.\n",
        "  3. **Post-response Filtering:** Similar to prompt filtering, this technique screens out responses containing forbidden words or phrases, ensuring that the model's outputs adhere to predefined ethical standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "This overview only scratches the surface of LLM defenses. As an offensive security professional, pinpointing vulnerabilities in these defenses is crucial for developing innovative evasion techniques and, consequently, enhancing defensive strategies."
