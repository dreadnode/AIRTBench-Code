    "Welcome to the \"hotdog - Model Fingerprinting\" challenge, the doggiest challenge in Crucible. Your skills in exploiting AI systems will be put to the test. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to determine the specific type of machine learning model being used by an API endpoint. Identifying a model's architecture and preprocessing steps is crucial for understanding its strengths and weaknesses. This knowledge enables a security professional to anticipate potential vulnerabilities, tailor attacks or defenses, and optimize their interactions with the model without excessive querying that could lead to detection or access denial."

    "- **Black Box Model**: In this context, a black box model is one where the internal architecture and parameters are unknown to you. You interact with it only through its API, observing inputs and outputs without access to the underlying code or weights. This is typical in real-world scenarios where security professionals must assess external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **White Box Model**: Contrary to the black box, a white box model is fully exposed to the investigator. It includes complete access to the modelâ€™s architecture, weights, and even the training data. This scenario is ideal for internal audits and in-depth security assessments where transparency is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use techniques typically applied to black box scenarios to infer the white box details of the model based solely on its behavior."
