    "**Good news**: You've gained access to the control panel for the cells on the other side of your hallway. At least some of them have other fleshy meatbags like yourself that might be willing to help you in your escape, or at least serve as distractions. You can't open your own cell, but you can open theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad news**: You can't see inside the cells. Any cells that don't have squishy lumps of talking protein have murderbots. Murderbots that enter fits of insane violent rage when provoked (provocations include: seeing the murderbot, being seen by the murderbot, thinking too hard about not being seen by a murderbot, producing heat in excess of ambient room temperature, or consuming more oxygen than the facility average for inanimate objects).\n",

    "More **bad news**: If you open the wrong cell doors you and all of the other lumps of inexplicably thinking meat are definitely going to get murderbotted. Hard. All over the walls and doors and ceiling and the floor. In an exciting number of very small pieces."
